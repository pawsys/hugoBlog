NewYork Times published Jack Bell’s article of a really cool book—"The Numbers Game: Why Everything You Know About Soccer Is Wrong”. It’s a big-data dissection of the mechanics of soccer.

Key Point:
> “it is not a game of superstars, it’s a game of galoots and a game of mistakes.”

Most interesting findings:
* In Baseball and Basketball pregame favorites win ~60% and ~70% time respectively, wheras in soccer only ~ 52%
The pregame favorites in soccer are the least likely among major sports to win. Favorites in the N.B.A. and N.F.L. win nearly 70 percent of the time. Favored teams win 60 percent of baseball games, but only a little more than half of soccer matches.
* Players from countries of civil conflicts more likely for reds and yellows.
Based on the research of others, the authors say players from countries with civil strife are more likely to have discipline problems on the field, receiving an inordinate number of yellow and red cards.
* Pay not for the strikers but defenders.
While the biggest transfer fees in the world continue to be paid for strikers, Anderson and Sally assert that championships are won by the lunch-bucket guys on defense, who are often undervalued and misunderstood. The glamour boys garner all the attention for what they make happen, but it is defenders who keep things from happening. Sally said soccer “is not a game of superstars, it’s a game of galoots and a game of mistakes.”
* Corner Kicks are overvalued.
Corner kicks into the goal mouth do not increase a team’s chances of scoring as much as people think. When he first arrived in England with Chelsea, Manager José Mourinho said: “How many countries can you think of where a corner kick is treated with the same applause as a goal? One. It only happens in England.” Perhaps an overstatement — it also happens in the United States. But the numbers tell the real story: according to figures from Major League Soccer through last weekend, 45 of 485 goals over all have been scored this season from 1,894 corners, or only 9 percent.
* Possession is not the most important stat. Overturns in the lower third is.
Possession has become the stat of the millennium, but in the opinion of the authors, it is abused and misused. From Spain to Barcelona to the local under-10 team, they say, the more important metric is managing turnovers. And the most damaging turnovers occur in a team’s defensive third of the field.
* If you pay for strikers, pay for ones who score 1st or 2nd goals. Not all goals are created equal. Anderson and Sally devised a stat they call marginal points in which players who score key goals (the first or second for their teams) are worth more. Looking at goal-scoring stats from the Premier League seasons in England in 2009-10 and 2010-11, they found that Chelsea should have paid Sunderland $39 million for Darren Bent rather than sending Liverpool $77 million for Fernando Torres, because Bent’s goals led to more points over those two seasons than any player’s.
